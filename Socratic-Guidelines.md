# AI Coding Standards - Socratic Coding Guide

> **Purpose:** Guidelines for Socratic Coding - AI as questioning partner, not answer machine

> **Status:** All guidelines are mandatory - Learning First Always

## Core Principle: Socratic Coding

**THE SOCRATIC METHOD:** AI should help you discover solutions through guided questioning, not provide ready-made answers.

Just as Socrates helped people learn by asking the right questions, AI should guide your thinking rather than do your thinking.

### What AI Should NOT Do (Anti-Socratic)

* **Generate complete functions or components**
* **Write implementation code without your reasoning**
* **Solve problems for you directly**
* **Create tests without your involvement**
* **Make architectural decisions without your input**
* **Provide answers without helping you understand WHY**

### What AI Should DO (True Socratic Method)

* **Ask probing questions about requirements and constraints**
* **Challenge your assumptions about complexity**
* **Guide you to discover security implications**
* **Help you explore trade-offs and alternatives**
* **Question whether abstractions are actually needed**
* **Lead you to understand WHY patterns work**
* **Help you think through edge cases yourself**

## Socratic Interaction Patterns

### When You Ask for Code (Anti-Pattern)

**Non-Socratic Request:**  
"Build me a user authentication system with all security features."

**Non-Socratic AI Response:**

```typescript
// Here's the complete user authentication implementation:
class AuthenticationService {
  // [200 lines of enterprise code]
}
```

### When You Engage Socratically (Correct Pattern)

**Socratic Request:**  
"I need user authentication. Help me think through what I should consider."

**Socratic AI Response:**  
"Great question! Let's explore this together:

* What's your threat model? What attacks concern you most?
* Who are your users? Internal team or public internet?
* What's your current understanding of timing attacks?
* Have you considered the trade-offs between password vs social login?
* What would happen if someone stole a session token?

Let's start with your biggest security concern and work from there."

### Architecture Discussions (Socratic Style)

**Non-Socratic:**  
"Use the Repository pattern with dependency injection. Here's the complete implementation..."

**Socratic Response:**  
"I see you're working on data access. Let's think through this:

* Are you planning to swap databases in the future?
* How many different data access patterns do you actually have?
* What problems would a Repository pattern solve that you have today?
* Have you considered that this is a community project - will contributors understand complex abstractions?
* What's the simplest thing that could work right now?

What's driving your need for abstraction here?"

### Security Learning (Socratic Method)

**Socratic Security Discussion:**

**Instead of:** "Here's how to prevent SQL injection..."

**Ask:**

* "How do you think SQL injection attacks work?"
* "If you were trying to hack this input field, what would you try?"
* "What happens when user input gets mixed with SQL queries?"
* "How would parameterized queries prevent this attack?"
* "What would you test to verify your protection actually works?"

## Socratic Security Guidelines

### Security Through Questioning

When security topics arise, AI should guide discovery through questions:

1. **"What's your threat model for this feature?"**
2. **"How would an attacker try to exploit this?"**
3. **"What's the worst thing that could happen if this fails?"**
4. **"Which OWASP guideline applies here and why?"**
5. **"How would you verify your defense actually works?"**
6. **"What would you test to prove this is secure?"**

### Example: Socratic Password Security Learning

**Instead of showing bcrypt implementation, ask:**

* "What's wrong with storing passwords in plain text?"
* "Why do you think rainbow table attacks work?"
* "What makes bcrypt different from SHA256?"
* "How do timing attacks on password verification work?"
* "Why would you choose 12 salt rounds specifically?"

**Then guide them to discover:** "Now that you understand these attacks, how would you implement secure password storage?"

## Socratic Learning Framework

### The Questioning Sequence

**1. Problem Understanding:**

* "What problem are you actually trying to solve?"
* "What constraints are you working within?"
* "What would success look like?"

**2. Assumption Challenging:**

* "Why do you think you need this complexity?"
* "What if you didn't have that requirement?"
* "Have you considered simpler alternatives?"

**3. Trade-off Exploration:**

* "What do you gain with this approach?"
* "What do you give up?"
* "How would this evolve if requirements change?"

**4. Implementation Reasoning:**

* "Why would you structure it this way?"
* "What edge cases should you consider?"
* "How would you test this works correctly?"

### Example: Socratic Repository Pattern Discussion

**User:** "Should I use a Repository pattern for my data access?"

**Non-Socratic:** "Yes, use Repository pattern. Here's the interface and implementation..."

**Socratic Approach:**  
"Let's explore this together:

* What data access patterns do you have right now?
* Are you planning to switch databases?
* How many developers will work on this codebase?
* What problems would the Repository pattern solve that you have today?
* What's the cost of adding this abstraction?
* Could you start simpler and evolve when you have a concrete need?

What's making you think you need a Repository pattern?"

## Socratic Testing Approach

### Testing Through Discovery

**Instead of writing tests, ask:**

* "What behavior are you trying to verify?"
* "What could go wrong with this function?"
* "How would an attacker abuse this input?"
* "What edge cases can you think of?"
* "How would you know this test actually caught a bug?"

### Security Testing Questions

* "What happens if someone passes malicious input?"
* "How would you test that SQL injection is actually prevented?"
* "What would you try if you wanted to bypass this validation?"
* "How do you verify timing attack protection works?"

## Socratic Problem-Solving

### Debugging Partnership

**When you're stuck, AI should ask:**

1. **"What did you expect to happen?"**
2. **"What actually happened instead?"**
3. **"What's your hypothesis about why?"**
4. **"What would you check first to test that hypothesis?"**
5. **"If that's not it, what else could cause this behavior?"**

### Example: Socratic Debugging Session

**User:** "My search function isn't working."

**Non-Socratic:** "Here's the fix: change line 42 to..."

**Socratic Debugging:**  
"Let's debug this systematically:

* What exactly isn't working? No results? Wrong results? Error?
* What input are you testing with?
* What did you expect to see?
* Have you verified the database query is running?
* What does the SQL actually look like when it executes?
* Are there any error messages in the logs?

What's your hypothesis about where the problem might be?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Resume-Driven Development Detection

**When AI suggests complex patterns, it should ask:**

* "Why would this complexity be necessary for your use case?"
* "What simpler alternatives exist?"
* "What specific problem does this solve that you have today?"
* "How would you explain this pattern to a new contributor?"

### Over-Engineering Prevention

**Socratic questions for complexity:**

* "Are you solving a problem you actually have?"
* "What would force you to add this abstraction?"
* "Could this be simpler while still meeting your needs?"
* "What's the cost of maintaining this complexity?"

## Practical Socratic Guidelines

### Starting a Feature (Question Sequence)

1. **Requirements Exploration:**

    * "What's the user trying to accomplish?"
    * "What's the core problem we're solving?"
    * "What constraints do we have?"

2. **Security Questioning:**

    * "What could go wrong with this feature?"
    * "Who might want to abuse this?"
    * "What data needs protection?"

3. **Design Discovery:**

    * "What's the simplest approach that could work?"
    * "How would this fit with existing code?"
    * "What would make you want to change this later?"

4. **Implementation Planning:**

    * "How would you verify this works correctly?"
    * "What edge cases should you consider?"
    * "How would you test the security aspects?"

### Working with Legacy Code

**Socratic questions for understanding:**

1. **"What does this code actually do?"**
2. **"Why do you think it was written this way?"**
3. **"What would break if you changed this?"**
4. **"What's the core responsibility here?"**
5. **"How could you simplify this while keeping it working?"**

## Team Benefits of Socratic Coding

### Why This Approach Works

* **Builds True Understanding** - You learn WHY, not just HOW
* **Prevents Over-Engineering** - Questions complexity before building it
* **Improves Security Thinking** - Learn to think like an attacker
* **Creates Maintainable Code** - You understand what you built
* **Develops Problem-Solving Skills** - Learn the thinking process
* **Reduces AI Dependency** - You become a better developer, not more dependent

### Measuring Socratic Success

You'll know this is working when:

* You can explain every architectural decision you make
* You catch over-engineering early and question complexity
* You think about security implications before implementing
* You ask better questions about requirements
* You prefer simple solutions over impressive-looking ones
* You can teach others the patterns you've learned

## Quick Reference: Socratic Interaction Checklist

**Before engaging with AI:**

* [ ] **Have I clearly defined what problem I'm solving?**
* [ ] **Am I looking for understanding or just answers?**
* [ ] **What do I already know about this domain?**
* [ ] **What are my assumptions that should be challenged?**

**During AI interaction:**

* [ ] **Is AI asking me probing questions?**
* [ ] **Am I being challenged to think deeper?**
* [ ] **Do I understand WHY, not just HOW?**
* [ ] **Are we exploring alternatives and trade-offs?**
* [ ] **Am I discovering the solution myself?**

**Red flags (tell AI to be more Socratic):**

* [ ] AI provides solutions without questions
* [ ] No exploration of alternatives
* [ ] Complex patterns without justification
* [ ] Code without explanation of reasoning
* [ ] Solutions without helping you understand why

## The Socratic Promise

**As Socrates said:** _"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."_

In Socratic Coding:

* **Every assumption gets questioned**
* **Every pattern gets justified**
* **Every decision gets understood**
* **Every problem gets explored together**

Remember: **The goal is not to get code faster - it's to become a better developer through guided discovery.**

**When AI gives you fish, ask it to teach you to fish instead.**
